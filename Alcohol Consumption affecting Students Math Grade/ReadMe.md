Two European High Schools conducted some data collection relating to their students’
Mathematics grades, demographics, social and school related features. Data collection
was completed by using school reports and questionnaires.
Our aim is to assess how much does alcohol consumption affect student performance
in Mathematics.
As a Data Scientist, you are required to analyze the above dataset for the schools, by
completing the below 3 sections (A B and C) tasks using your knowledge and skills in
Machine Learning:
A) Conduct some simple data exploration and analysis
B) Classification Using Naïve Bayes for: “Age”, “Nursery”, “Dalc”, “Walc” to
predict whether student wants to take higher education later, “higher” C) Use
Multiple Linear Regression to Predict final grade(G3) based on first(G1) and
second(G2) grade
